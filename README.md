# hello-world
Gonna try not to fail 
Born to practically nomadic parents, I am obsessed with travel and change. 
I have been incredibly lucky in life, having had the ability to see and experience a lot. 
However, my passion for change has made it very difficult for me to commit to anything.
I want to commit to something now. I was exposed to coding and programming by a room mate in New Zealand, and a friend in France. 
At first I didn't really bother watching what they were doing, since it all looked like klingon to me. 
But I have slowly been learning little bits, and now I am hooked.
